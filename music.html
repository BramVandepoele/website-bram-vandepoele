                <h1>Music</h1>
                <p>I am a big fan of music. No day passes without me listening to some music on spotify or on vinyl and when I use public transport I never leave without my headphones.</p>
                
                <h2>Genres</h2>
                <p>I mostly listen to hard rock and metal. Ever since I heard the album 'Brave New World' by 'Iron Maiden' i've been hooked. <br/>I go to concerts quite often and you can find me at Graspop Metal Meeting almost every year (if it doens't get canceled due to Covid-19).</p>
                <iframe class="spotify" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/1hDF0QPIHVTnSJtxyQVguB"  allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>
                
                <h2>Instruments</h2>
                <p>Not only do I like listening to music, I also like playing it. I play 3 different instruments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bass guitar (I got my first bass when I was 12 years old</li>
                    <li>Electric guitar (I'm not really that good but I like playing it every once in a while)</li>
                    <li>Drums (I only started playing the drums quite recently, so I still have a long way to go)</li>
                </ul>
